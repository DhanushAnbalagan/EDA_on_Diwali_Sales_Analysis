# EDA_on_Diwali_Sales_Analysis

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Diwali sales data. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify sales patterns, and gain insights into the sales trends during the Diwali season.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, I explored various aspects of Diwali sales, including:
- Sales distribution across occupations
- Gender-based purchasing patterns
- Age group spending behavior
- Product category popularity
- Marital status wise

The analysis uses visualizations to uncover trends and make observations that can help businesses understand their customers and optimize their marketing strategies during Diwali.
